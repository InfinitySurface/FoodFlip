    <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">The collective decision of the students to do an online recipe book using different concepts that was learned during CS-4393-001 classroom sessions. What do we expect to gain from this website? What effect will the results have on the overall application? How much design can determine the application learning processes from a user? Are there any differences between different usability throughout the development process.  </p>
    <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">We have learned as a group to work together to produce an effective and efficient product within the time span that was given. Developing this software product had many stages that the students needed to go through and the realization throughout the semester was crucial in the learning point of the studentâ€™s college career. The concept of planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance of the development are the building blocks of this application. Our group has experience all those stages that allowed productivity. </p>
    <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">Thank you team!</p>
